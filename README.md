# ☢️ Defcon: Nuclear Warfare Plugin

_This Minecraft plugin for spigot adds Nuclear energy and the weapons that come with it._
Nuke your opponents from your base with missiles and witness the destruction power of nuclear weapons.

## ✅ Simple guide on installing the plugin.

Make sure the server software is **paper spigot 1.19.3** and not spigot!

Install **Protocollib**, **Worldedit**, **Worldguard** and **Vault**.

When the server starts for the first time, it will automatically install the datapack and the server will restart automatically.

For sounds and gui effects, the plugin will automatically generate a resource pack in the server root, so take it and put it in the ResourcePack folder in your minecraft client.
